# Angular Cli Universal Example

A simple example of angular server side rendering using [@angular/cli][@angular/cli], [@nguniversal/express-engine][@nguniversal/express-engine] and [@ngx-universal/state-transfer][@ngx-universal/state-transfer]

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Run server build

Run `npm run build:server` to generate the server build. Or run `npm run start:server` to generate the server build and run the server app.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
